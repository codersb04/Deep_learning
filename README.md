# Deep_learning
In this repository I would be sharing my practice work in Deep learning.

## Gradient Descent for Neural Network
- Created a gradient descent model from scratch and compared it with tensorflow Neural Network Model
-  Model is build using Isurance_Data which is included in the repositary
-  Dataset: https://github.com/codebasics/deep-learning-keras-tf-tutorial/blob/master/6_gradient_descent/insurance_data.csv</br></br></br>
